Calculating ROI manually is time-consuming and error-prone, especially when data comes from multiple sources.This project aims to solve that problem by building a simple, web-based tool that automatically calculates and stores ROI for each invoice, giving users clear and quick insights into their financial performance.

1.Planned Approach & Architecture
Frontend - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend - Flask in Python
The data is stored locally in an SQLite database

2.Flow of the application:
User → Frontend → Flask API → SQLite DB → Flask Response → UI Update

3.Technologies and Tools:
Frontend- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript-For user interface and interactions
Backend	- Flask (Python)-To handle routes, APIs, and calculations
Database- SQLite-To store invoice data and ROI results
Development Tools - VS Code, Git, GitHub-For coding, version control, and collaboration

4.Key Features
1.Add Invoices Easily
Users can enter invoice details such as cost and revenue. The app automatically calculates ROI using: ROI = ((Revenue - Cost) / Cost) × 100

2.View and Manage Data
All invoices are saved in the database and can be viewed or deleted anytime.

3.Instant ROI Insights
The dashboard shows important metrics like total invoices, average ROI, and top-performing entries.

4.Smooth and Responsive Interface
The frontend updates dynamically using Fetch API, so there’s no need to reload the page.
